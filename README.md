# R* Tree

### A Java implementation of the R*-Tree paper 

This repository contains all the necessary Java code that, given a set of points in a .osm file and their dimensionality, 
they can be indexed efficiently, as per the R*-Tree paper.

### Example
In the following plot we can see points and how the algorithm puts them together in bounding rectangles, in order for efficient queries, additions and deletions.
